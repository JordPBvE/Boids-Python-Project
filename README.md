# Boids-Python-Project

## A python3 implementation of Boids. 

Boids (short for bird-oid) is the name for a specific type of simulation that attempts to flocking behavior. This is a python3 implementation of that simulation (with some added controls).

## Controls:

- `p`: pause / resume boids (stops boid movement)
- `LEFT/RIGHT (arrow)`: Change color palette
- `b`: activate build mode (allows one to place obstacles)
  - `SPACE`: switch between build modes ("default" <> "polygon")
  - `LMB`: build circle obstacle (while in "default" build mode) / place polygon vertex (while in "polygon" build mode)
  - `RMB`: finish polygon (while in "polygon" build mode)
- `m`: activate mouse-following mode
- `d`: enable debug mode
- `ESC` / `q`: return to default mode.

## Context

This project was made by Jord van Eldik and Teun van Wezel during an introductory course on python programming at Utrecht University.
